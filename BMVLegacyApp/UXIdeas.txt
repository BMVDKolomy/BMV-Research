"requirements cannot be gathered" kim goodwin
- Requirements have to be GENERATED
- Requirements have to be IDEATED
- Requirements have to be UNCOVERED
- Requirements are most often NEGOTATED

The idea of "gathering" reduces every person in the room to the role of order taker, which:
- decreases you ability to help them get to the RIGHT SOLUTION
- decreases you VALUE to that client or employer
- decreases what they're willing to PAY you

Poor tools
- Use cases - aren'1 enough
- User stories - aren'1 enough

requirements should address success
The ability to view a data chart onscreen in COMPLETE TASK - Beign able to make sense of what you see and act on it is SUCCESS
Sharing a deliverable file with a colleague is a COMPLETE TASK - Tracking its version and ensuring there are no duplicate files is SUCCESS
The ablility to file a tax return online is a COMPLETE TASK - Confidence nothing's missed, the math is right and no chance of audit is SUCCESS

Start early:
- Their job title (B2B)
- Their day-to-day responsibilities (B2B0
- How they use the product now.
- What other products they use to do the same thing
- How the Client thinks they use the product
- What features the Client thinks are important to them

Creating context
There are tow parts to contextual personas
	- Develop empathy, Understanding the emotional drivers that affect the user's behavior - 
	because emotion will trump intellect in almost every situation
	- Uncover behavioral attributes in the context of multiple situations. What is the user doing?
	What have they just done? What are they thinking and feeling? How does that affect what they do next?
	
tools for creating context
	- Empathy Mapping uncovers a user's perceptions, influences a goals.
	- Situational Mapping uncovers situational factors that affect the context of use - along with needs and desired outcomes.
	- Contextual Use Scenarios expose isues related to flow, constraints, task sequences and related artifacts.
We use these tools to uncover and validate the relevance and value of out requirements.

all requirements are not created equal. 
Questions about required data
WHY do we need each of these data points?
WHAT do we need to be able to do with this data?
HOW do we/users benefit from having this data?

requirements are not features
	Features are solutions
	Requirements are all about identifying needs
